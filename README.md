# FlowerShop
The project involves creating a comprehensive website for a flower shop named "सोनचाफा" (Sonchafa), showcasing various aspects of the business, including products, customer reviews, and contact information. The website is designed to appeal to Marathi-speaking customers, incorporating cultural elements and local language for better engagement.
